Data scrape and visualization

Introduction

In this project, I want to scrape the data form webpage(weather.com) and make the data visulizabable.
Follow are overall thought process:

1 Get the response information of the page to be scraped through the URL (using the Requests library).

2 Structured parsing of the response through the parsing library in python (use of the BeautifulSoup library).

3 Organize data into a certain format for storage (use of Pandas library).

4 Filter and organize the data in the database for the initial display of data visualization (use of Matplotlib library).

In code part,we use python to scrape data form weather.com,specificlly 10 days forecast.Then we organize data and show 
them in a figure.
