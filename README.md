Data visualization
Introduction

Python's position in data science is not only because of numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, which are efficient and easy to use, and the interface is unified scientific computing package. Its powerful data visualization tool is also an important part. 
In Python, the most used data visualization tool is matplotlib, in addition to many other optional visualization toolkits, including the following major categories:

1 Matplotlib and toolkit based on matplotlib: the drawing function of the matplotlib API in pandas, seaborn, networkx, etc.
2 Visualization tools based on JavaScript and d3.js: plotly, etc. These tools can display dynamic graphs with certain interactivity.
3 Other visualization tools that provide Python call interfaces: OpenGL, GraphViz, etc. These tools have their own characteristics and are   widely used in specific fields.


In this project, I want to gigure out:

How to generate a data set and how to visualize it;
How to use matplotlib to create simple charts and how to use scatter plots to explore random walks;
How to use Pygal to create a histogram, and how to use a histogram to explore the results of throwing two dice with different faces at the same time.
